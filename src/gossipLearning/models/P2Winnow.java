/**
 * <p>
 * The Positive Winnow algorithm in distributed environment.
 * This algorithm based on the Winnow concept. We assume, 
 * that the given examples (x) are not negatives 
 * (so x_j >= 0 for all j and for all samples). This assumption
 * is usually satisfied in NLP tasks.
 * The algorithm needs two parameters: a <code>theta</code> threshold 
 * and an <code>eta</code> learning constant. <code>theta</code>
 * will be used for prediction and <code>eta</code> for learning. 
 * </p><p>
 * The algorithm maintains a weight vector, which have to
 * be initialized to some positive number (e.g. 1.0).
 * </p><p>
 * By prediction, we calculate the inner product of the
 * weight vector and the given instance. If this value is 
 * greater than the <code>theta</code> threshold, we predict 
 * the instance as positive, otherwise as negative.
 * </p><p>
 * By learning, we predict the instance's label. If we predicted
 * it correctly, we have to do nothing (passive case). If we 
 * have misclassified the instance, we have to do the promotion
 * or demotion step. That is, if the correct label was positive 
 * (and we predicted as negative), we have to multiply the 
 * weight vector with 1+eta (1+eta > 1). As we predicted a
 * negative sample as positive, we have to multiply the weights
 * with a positive number, which lesser than 1 (e.g. 1/(1+eta))
 * We only have to modify that coordinates, which were presented
 * in the instance (so where x_j > 0).
 * </p><p>
 * This implementation based on article from 
 * Vitor R. Carvalho and William W. Cohen:
 * <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~vitor/papers/onlinetechreport.pdf">
 * Notes on Single-Pass Online Learning Algorithms
 * </a> article.
